New year,new flags. 

For me, the most important thing ofcourse this year is to join a new team and switch to a new field.
I hope to master the business as soon as possible, integrate into the new environment, and do my job best as before.
Before ruanyifeng sent a tweet message, "in the current Internet age, if you did not make a voice on the network,Then you are a person who does not exist." Although I am a programmer, a digital worker.But most of the time it was a consumer of online 
information, not a creator.This year I hope to make more voice on the Internet.
Maybe I will write some blogs and record some video tutorials.
Although the plan is written every year, many plans have not been completed.
I still believe that step by step according to the plan, there will be a good result in the end.
